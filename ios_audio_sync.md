# IAA/AU host sync vs Ableton Link sync

Implementing these two are actually quite similar.
The idea is that in each render buffer, you check where you *should be* at the end of this buffer, or actually where you should be at the first sample of the *next* buffer.

## Host sync

Call the host beatAndTempoProc callback, that you have cached in a variable.
Take the beat time it returns and add the number of beats that fits in the current buffer according to the tempo you got from the callback.
Note that the tempo might fluctuate and be different for each render cycle, for example if the host is in turn syncing to Link or something else that makes it do slight adjustments for each buffer.

## Link
Call ABLLinkBeatTimeAtHostTime(), passing it the mHostTime given in your render callback timestamp and add the buffer duration in host ticks, as well as the device output latency + any additional delay youâ€™re adding to your audio.
You can calculate the exact tempo for this buffer by checking how many beats that fits in the buffer.

## Towards the next beat time
Then you need a way to get there in a nice way. It might be enough to just change the playback rate/speed.
More advanced techniques might involve time stretching.

If the jump from your current beat time is too big, or going backwards, then you should handle this by relocating to the correct beat position. The beat time can and will go backwards, when the host rewinds or when Link waits for the phase to reach the next sync quantum.

If your app is sensitive to jitter, you might want to smooth the rate of change, but in such a way that no change is lost, only accumulated and spread over a longer time period.

## Detect if host provides IAA sync

```objc
HostCallbackInfo callbackInfo;
callbackInfo.hostUserData = NULL;
UInt32 dataSize = sizeof(HostCallbackInfo);
AudioUnitGetProperty(unit, kAudioUnitProperty_HostCallbacks, kAudioUnitScope_Global, 0, &callbackInfo, &dataSize);
BOOL hostProvidesBeatSync = callbackInfo.hostUserData && callbackInfo.beatAndTempoProc(callbackInfo.hostUserData,NULL,NULL) == noErr;
```

An app should use IAA sync if available, else fall back to Link if enabled.
So the app should use `ABLLinkSetActive()` to deactivate Link while syncing to IAA, and disable or hide the Link button in the app.
